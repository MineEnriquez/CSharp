# About Abstract Classes

* Why and when should we use an abstract class
* Give an example of where we could use an abstract class

PROBLEM:
Having two very similar classes, class 1 and class 2, notice that there is only very few differences.
Definitelly related.
There is a lot of common properties and methods.
There is a lot of duplicate code.
If we want to add 'Middle name' we have to do it in both classes, so,mainteinability is not good.

CLASS 1:
Full Time employee

CLASS 2:
Contract Employee
